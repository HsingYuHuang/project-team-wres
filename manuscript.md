# Dataset Description{.page_break_before}

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We propose to use Goose Creek Eddy Covariance Flux Tower Sensor Data(Kumar & Sargent, 2024). The data is collected from the Eddy Covariance Flux Tower in Goose Creek, Piatt County. The dataset consists of time series data spanning from Spring 2016 to Spring 2023 with 15 minutes time interval. Dataset involves 167 variables shown in Table 1 including latent heat, sensible heat, wind speed, temperature, and changes in the ecosystem with respect to water, carbon, and temperature. Figure 1 illustrates part of variables in 2022. The data collected by flux tower provides a foundation for further investigation into hydrological, meteorological, and environmental phenomena. The format of dataset is CSV file (generated from raw PICKLE file). The dataset can be found through link: <https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/c276c71e8d1246e29d8502f5b2054668/>

# Proposal

## Background

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Evapotranspiration (ET) is the process of water transferring from land to the atmosphere, accompanying the phase change of water from liquid to gas. This process plays a critical role in the ecohydrological system and profoundly affects the hydrological cycle. The processes of evapotranspiration and energy exchange are interdependent. Both latent heat (LE) and evapotranspiration (ET), from the perspective of energy and water flux, are key terms for anticipating weather conditions, simulating climate, and diagnosing climate change. However, the measurement of evapotranspiration is challenging because the process itself is invisible and complex.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Figure 2 shows the latent heat data gap in 2020 due to covid-19 and overhaul of equipment. Our project goal is to fill in these missing data. The ground truth data is collected from satelite sensors (<https://etdata.org/>). Despite the existence of numerous classical evapotranspiration simulation models, such as Bowen Ratio, Priestley-Taylor and Penman-Monteith models, the predictive accuracy of these models is inferior to that of deep learning models. Therefore, we plan to use RNN and LSTM deep learning models to predict latent heat and fill the gap.

## Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We have 167 variables in the dataset. Although we can filter some ET related variables based on empirical models, these variables may not accurate and AI models tend to obtain adequate information. Therefore, we propose to conduct regression analysis to find out variables highly correlated to latent heat. These variables will be input variables in deep learning model. To simplify the process of figuring out how these factors interact and vary across different times of the day and seasons, we focus on the first five data of main variables first. The main variables include Timestamp, Observed latent heat flux (LE_Obs), Net radiation (Rn), Temperature in degrees Celsius (T), Air_Pressure and etc. Table 2 shows the first 5 data of each variable as follows:
</p>


## Step 2: Predictive Modeling (Deep Learning Time Series Forecast, Time Series Imputation)


Once we confirm the input variables, we plan to use RNN or LSTM forecast models to predict latent heat in 2020. All the input are divided into training datasets and the validation datasets. After the RNN model is trained, the validation datasets are used to verify the model. At last, the missing data are generated by the model.For Deliverable 3, the goal is to create a predictive model to estimate missing values or forecast future measurements, specifically targeting `LE_Obs` (Latent Heat Flux), due to its environmental relevance. The model plan includes:

1. **Problem Definition**: Use time-series forecasting to predict `LE_Obs` based on the past sequences of environmental variables. Predicting `LE_Obs` could help estimate latent heat flux in unmeasured periods, contributing to more complete energy balance data.
2. **Feature Selection**: Include variables closely related to `LE_Obs`, such as `Rn`, `T`, `Relative Humidity`, and `Sensible_H`. These will serve as predictive features as they capture the interactions of surface energy components.
3. **Model Choice**: Implement an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model due to its suitability for time-series data, capturing sequential dependencies and trends. Using an LSTM allows the model to learn from past data sequences, making it appropriate for forecasting latent heat flux.
4. **Evaluation Metric**: Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model’s performance, as it penalizes larger errors and is commonly used in regression tasks.
5. **Training Plan**: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that the test set consists of the most recent data. Train the model on scaled data to improve performance and use the validation set for hyperparameter tuning.

# Predictive Modeling

In this section, we propose to use Machine Learning methods to simulate target variable latent heat. Source variables are shown in the above table. Specifically, our methods include regression, single layer neural network, multi layer neural network, CNN network and LSTM. Figures and results are shown in following content including the scatter, time series plot, $R^2$, $MSE$ value between observed and simulated latent heat.

## Regression
### Basic Regression without processing

Based on gradient descent, we look for a vector $beta$ which can minimize the difference between simulated and observed value. Since our system has 9 source variables, we want to obtain a vector with 9 values which are the coefficient for each source variable. The equation is,

$L E=\beta_1 R n+\beta_2 T+\beta_3 P a+\beta_4 G+\beta_5 V W C+\beta_6 V W C diff +\beta_7 H+\beta_8 R H+\beta_9 V P$

At beginning, we didn't apply any processing on our data and we input the original data directly. Our learning rate is 0.001 and learning step is 10000 Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the scatter and time series plot for both observed and simulated latent heat. From these two figures, we can observe the regression method capture the correct seansonal variation of latent heat. However, the bias between two groups of data is obvious. The error metrics also reflect this phenomenon since R-squared value is over 70 percent which is great, but MSE and RMSE values are too large for the latent heat.

![Fig 7: Scatter plot based on basic regression (Test Set)](./images/RegressionScatterPlot2021.png){width=80%}

Based on the regression result, we obtain the following regression equation to obtain latent heat.

$$
LE = 35.2 R_n - 0.22 T - 3.95 P_a - 6.96 G + 4.03 VWC + 1.40 VWC diff - 14.39 H + 2.56 RH + 11.07 VP
$$

Overall, the regression equation is meaningful since LE has positive relationship with Rn and negative relationship with G and H based on the theoretical energy balance eqaution. In the regression equation, we can observe the positive coefficient for Rn and negative coefficient for G and H.

$L E=R_n-G-H$

### Normalized Regression
In order to solve the bias problem, we aim to conduct processing treatment on our original dataset. Thus, we normalize the data to conver the value from 0 to 1. Then we conduct same regression process as the basic regression section. The learning rate and steps are 0.05 and 10000 respectively. The predict result is shown in figures 6 and 7.

![Fig 8: Time series plot based on normalized regression (Training Set)](./images/NormalizedRegressionTimePlot.png){width=80%}

![Fig 9: Scatter plot based on normalized regression (Training Set)](./images/NormalizedRegressionScatterPlot.png){width=80%}

![Fig 11: Scatter plot based on normalized regression (Test Set)](./images/NormalizedRegressionScatterPlot2021.png){width=80%}

Based on these figures, we can see the prediction result is accurate. Simulated LE has the same variation and range as observed LE. According to error metrics, although R-squared value decreases from 71% to 69%, MSE and RMSE decreases significantly revealing a better result than basic regression. For the normalized regression model, we get the regression equation is


$$
LE = 189.29 \, R_n + 4.91 \, T - 15.69 \, Pa - 37.38 \, G + 29.35 \, \text{VWC} + 40.51 \, \text{VWC diff} - 122.88 \, H + 27.49 \, RH + 37.36 \, VP
$$

### PCA Regression
The last PCA regression model aims to slove the generalization difficulty. We conduct PCA analysis first to obtain three dominant component. Then we apply the regression analysis based on these three components. The learning steps and learning rate is 10000 and 0.001. Figure 9 illustrate PCA regression can obtain similar trend as observed latent heat value. However, the simulated model lack the ability to capture the extreme large and small value. Thus, the predictive performance is lower than previous normalized regression model based on the error metrics. In addition, we can find the accuracy in test set is very poor since we conduct PCA analysis seperately for test and training set. Thus, the principal components of the training and test sets are inconsistent which results in the poor predictive performance.

![Fig 15: Scatter plot based on PCA regression (Test Set)](./images/PCARegressionScatterPlot2021.png){width=80%}

Therefore, we reanalysze the system by checking the PCA for training and testing set together. Figures 18 and 19 illustrate combined PCA regression has better performance than the seperated PCA regression.

## Neural Network
### Single Layer Neural Network
This section uses single layer neural network to predict latent heat. The learning steps and learning rate is 100000 and 0.01. Figures 20 and 21 demonstrate that involving contant value in model is better than previous regression models.

![Fig 23: Scatter plot based on single layer neural network (Test Set)](./images/SingleNNRegressionScatterPlot2021.png){width=80%}

### Double Layer Neural Network
We continue to use deep layer neural network with double layer to predict latent heat. The learning steps and learning rate is 100000 and 0.01 same as previous network. The hidden size is 20 and the output size is 1. Figures 12 and 13 show double layer neural network has better predictive performance with R-squred value over 80% and RMSE value smaller than 20.

![Fig 24: Time series plot based on double layer neural network (Training Set)](./images/DoubleNNRegressionTimePlot.png){width=80%}

![Fig 25: Scatter plot based on double layer neural network (Test Set)](./images/DoubleNNRegressionScatterPlot2021.png){width=80%}

### Quadra Layer Neural Network
The quadra layer neural network has four layers of network with hidden size 20, 15, 10 and output size 1. The learning steps and rate is 100000 and 0.01 as well. Based on figures 26 and 27, we can see this network continue to improve the predictive performance. It has higher R-squared and lower RMSE value than double layer network. However, we also ovserved the generalization problem of this quadra layer neural network. It has very poor performance on test set with R-squared 48%.

![Fig 29: Scatter plot based on quadra layer neural network (Test Set)](./images/QuadraNNRegressionScatterPlot2021.png){width=80%}

### CNN
In this section, we plan to use CNN network to predict latent heat although CNN has better performance with image tasks. The CNN network involves Input Layer, 1D Convolutional Layer, ReLU Activation Function, Max Pooling Layer and Fully Connected Layer. Although it doesn't has better performance than previous neural network, it has better generalization ability since the predictive performance of test dataset is improved (Figures 27 and 29).

![Fig 27: Scatter plot based on CNN neural network (Test Set)](./images/CNNRegressionScatterPlot2021.png){width=80%}

### LSTM
Finally, we are trying to use LSTM to predict latent heat.
