## Dataset Description

The data is collected from the Eddy Covariance Flux Tower in Goose Creek, Piatt County. The dataset consists of time series data spanning from Spring 2016 to Spring 2023. The data elements include wind speed, temperature, and changes in the ecosystem with respect to water, carbon, and temperature.

## Proposal

Evapotranspiration (ET) is the process of water transferring from land to the atmosphere, accompanying the phase change of water from liquid to gas. This process plays a critical role in the ecohydrological system and profoundly affects the hydrological cycle. The processes of evapotranspiration and energy exchange are interdependent. Both latent heat (LE) and evapotranspiration (ET), from the perspective of energy and water flux, are key terms for anticipating weather conditions, simulating climate, and diagnosing climate change. However, the measurement of evapotranspiration is challenging because the process itself is invisible and complex.
